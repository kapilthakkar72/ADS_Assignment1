Pastry & Chord DHT
===============

The aim of this project is to compare Pastry & Chord DHT. Both are simulated & the below results are then noted.
<br><br>
<b>Pastry:</b><br>
<ul>
	<li>Average number of routing hops</li>
	<li>Average number of messages for node addition</li>
	<li>Node Failures</li>
	<li>Time per operation</li>
	<li>Efficacy per routing</li>
	<li>Routing table occupancy</li>
</ul>	
<br>
<b>Chord:</b><br>
<ul>
	<li>Average number of hops per lookup operation</li>
	<li>Average number of updates per addition</li>
	<li>Average number of updates per deletion</li>
	<li>Average time to perform addition</li>
	<li>Average time to perform deletion</li>
</ul>

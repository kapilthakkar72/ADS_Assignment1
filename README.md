Pastry & Chord DHT
===============

The aim of this project is to compare Pastry & Chord DHT. Both are simulated & the below results are then noted.

Pastry:
	1. Average number of routing hops
	2. Average number of messages for node addition
	3. Node Failures
	4. Time per operation
	5. Efficacy per routing
	6. Routing table occupancy
	
Chord:
	1. Average number of hops per lookup operation
	2. Average number of updates per addition
	3. Average number of updates per deletion
	4. Average time to perform addition
	5. Average time to perform deletion

Please go through "Docs/pastry-chord-simulation.pdf" for the detailed analysis.

Pastry & Chord DHT
===============

The aim of this project is to compare Pastry & Chord DHT. Both are simulated & the below results are then noted.
<br><br>
<b>Pastry:</b>
	1. Average number of routing hops  <br>
	2. Average number of messages for node addition<br>
	3. Node Failures<br>
	4. Time per operation<br>
	5. Efficacy per routing<br>
	6. Routing table occupancy<br>
	<br><br>
<b>Chord:</b>
	1. Average number of hops per lookup operation<br>
	2. Average number of updates per addition<br>
	3. Average number of updates per deletion<br>
	4. Average time to perform addition<br>
	5. Average time to perform deletion<br>
<br><br>
